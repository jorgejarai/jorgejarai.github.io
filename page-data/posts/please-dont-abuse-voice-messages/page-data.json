It’s not a big deal for me if it is something occasional, but when it comes to people whose main way to send information to others is by voice messages I cannot but scream internally when I have to listen to three minute-long messages that I can’t listen at a 2x speed rate (if the folks at WhatsApp really cared about UX, they should have implemented features like this a long time ago; probably this wouldn’t be such a “problem” for me if that were the case).</p>\n<p>I’m a person with a relatively low attention span, and that’s the reason I like things done fast. If you’re going to spend 15 minutes in saying something that could have been said in less than 3, you lost me. I know that voice is a lot more expressive than sending a string of text with one or two emojis, but please: use them wisely. At least try to plan what you’re going to record and be concise. People like me will thank you.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/please-dont-abuse-voice-messages","tagSlugs":["/tag/rants/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-05-26T22:40:32.169Z","description":"Just a quick rant for having something published on the page.","tags":["Rants"],"title":"Please Don't Abuse Voice Messages","socialImage":{"publicURL":"/static/f463ff7592afdee2e8660e64fb228e0c/photo.jpg"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/please-dont-abuse-voice-messages"}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","401334301","825871152"]}
